== Description ==

Tiles Proxy for OpenStreetMap provides a basic proxy, which allows other OpenStreetMap plugins to load map tiles from your server instead from OpenStreetMap servers.

**Contribute**: [https://github.com/moewe-io/osm-tiles-proxy](https://github.com/moewe-io/osm-tiles-proxy)

**Known to work with these plugins**

* [Leaflet Map](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/leaflet-map/)
* Another plugin? Let us [know](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/osm-tiles-proxy).

**Notes**

* *Beware*: Depending on your map and the tiles you need, a lot of storage is needed.
* Might be slower than official servers (depends on your server)
* First requests might be slow as map tiles are cached on request

**Filters**

You can use filters to get the URLs from the plugin:

`
  $proxy_cached_url   = apply_filters( 'osm_tiles_proxy_get_proxy_url', $proxy_cached_url );
  $proxy_rest_api_url = apply_filters( 'osm_tiles_proxy_get_proxy_rest_url', $proxy_rest_api_url );
  $leadlet_js_url     = apply_filters( 'osm_tiles_proxy_get_leaflet_js_url', $leadlet_js_url );
  $leadlet_css_url    = apply_filters( 'osm_tiles_proxy_get_leaflet_css_url', $leadlet_css_url );
`
**Constants**

To disable cache invalidation when WP Rocket or WP Fastest Cache invalidate their cache, you can set the following constant in your `wp-config.php`
`
define( 'OSM_PROXY_DISABLE_CLEAR_CACHE', true );
`
